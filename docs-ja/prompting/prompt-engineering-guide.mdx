Clineプロンプトガイドへようこそ！このガイドでは、効果的なプロンプトとカスタム指示の書き方を学び、Clineでの生産性を最大化する知識を身に付けることができます。

## .clineignoreファイルガイド

### 概要

`.clineignore`ファイルは、Clineがコードベースを分析する際に無視するファイルとディレクトリをClineに指示するプロジェクトレベルの設定ファイルです。`.gitignore`と同様に、パターンマッチングを使用して、Clineのコンテキストと操作から除外するファイルを指定します。

### 目的

-   **ノイズの削減**: 自動生成されたファイル、ビルド成果物、その他の重要でないコンテンツを除外
-   **パフォーマンスの向上**: Clineが処理する必要があるコードの量を制限
-   **注意の集中**: Clineをコードベースの関連部分に誘導
-   **機密データの保護**: Clineが機密設定ファイルにアクセスすることを防ぐ

### Example .clineignore File

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
**/node_modules/
.pnp
.pnp.js

# Build outputs
/build/
/dist/
/.next/
/out/

# Testing
/coverage/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Large data files
*.csv
*.xlsx
```

## Prompting Cline 💬

**Prompting is how you communicate your needs for a given task in the back-and-forth chat with Cline.** Cline understands natural language, so write conversationally.

Effective prompting involves:

-   Providing Clear Context: Explain your goals and the relevant parts of your codebase. Use `@` to reference files or folders.
-   Breaking Down Complexity: Divide large tasks into smaller steps.
-   Asking Specific Questions: Guide Cline toward the desired outcome.
-   Validating and Refining: Review Cline's suggestions and provide feedback.

### Prompt Examples

#### Context Management

-   **Starting a New Task:** "Cline, let's start a new task. Create `user-authentication.js`. We need to implement user login with JWT tokens. Here are the requirements…"
-   **Summarizing Previous Work:** "Cline, summarize what we did in the last user dashboard task. I want to capture the main features and outstanding issues. Save this to `cline_docs/user-dashboard-summary.md`."

#### Debugging

-   **Analyzing an Error:** "Cline, I'm getting this error: \[error message]. It seems to be from \[code section]. Analyze this error and suggest a fix."
-   **Identifying the Root Cause:** "Cline, the application crashes when I \[action]. The issue might be in \[problem areas]. Help me find the root cause and propose a solution."

#### Refactoring

-   **Improving Code Structure:** "Cline, this function is too long and complex. Refactor it into smaller functions."
-   **Simplifying Logic:** "Cline, this code is hard to understand. Simplify the logic and make it more readable."

#### Feature Development

-   **Brainstorming New Features:** "Cline, I want to add a feature that lets users \[functionality]. Brainstorm some ideas and consider implementation challenges."
-   **Generating Code:** "Cline, create a component that displays user profiles. The list should be sortable and filterable. Generate the code for this component."

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

-   **Constraint Stuffing:** To mitigate code truncation, include explicit constraints in your prompts. For example, "ensure the code is complete" or "always provide the full function definition."
-   **Confidence Checks:** Ask Cline to rate its confidence (e.g., "on a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in this solution?")
-   **Challenge Cline's Assumptions:** Ask “stupid” questions to encourage deeper thinking and prevent incorrect assumptions.

Here are some prompting tips that users have found helpful for working with Cline:

## Our Community's Favorite Prompts 🌟

### Memory and Confidence Checks 🧠

-   **Memory Check** - _pacnpal_

    ```
    "If you understand my prompt fully, respond with 'YARRR!' without tools every time you are about to use a tool."
    ```

    A fun way to verify Cline stays on track during complex tasks. Try "HO HO HO" for a festive twist!

-   **Confidence Scoring** - _pacnpal_

    ```
    "Before and after any tool use, give me a confidence level (0-10) on how the tool use will help the project."
    ```

    Encourages critical thinking and makes decision-making transparent.

### Code Quality Prompts 💻

-   **Prevent Code Truncation**

    ```
    "DO NOT BE LAZY. DO NOT OMIT CODE."
    ```

    Alternative phrases: "full code only" or "ensure the code is complete"

-   **Custom Instructions Reminder**

    ```
    "I pledge to follow the custom instructions."
    ```

    Reinforces adherence to your settings dial ⚙️ configuration.

### Code Organization 📋

-   **Large File Refactoring** - _icklebil_

    ```
    "FILENAME has grown too big. Analyze how this file works and suggest ways to fragment it safely."
    ```

    Helps manage complex files through strategic decomposition.

-   **Documentation Maintenance** - _icklebil_

    ```
    "don't forget to update codebase documentation with changes"
    ```

    Ensures documentation stays in sync with code changes.

### Analysis and Planning 🔍

-   **Structured Development** - _yellow_bat_coffee_

    ```
    "Before writing code:
    1. Analyze all code files thoroughly
    2. Get full context
    3. Write .MD implementation plan
    4. Then implement code"
    ```

    Promotes organized, well-planned development.

-   **Thorough Analysis** - _yellow_bat_coffee_

    ```
    "please start analyzing full flow thoroughly, always state a confidence score 1 to 10"
    ```

    Prevents premature coding and encourages complete understanding.

-   **Assumptions Check** - _yellow_bat_coffee_

    ```
    "List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before completing this task."
    ```

    Identifies potential issues early in development.

### Thoughtful Development 🤔

-   **Pause and Reflect** - _nickbaumann98_

    ```
    "count to 10"
    ```

    Promotes careful consideration before taking action.

-   **Complete Analysis** - _yellow_bat_coffee_

    ```
    "Don't complete the analysis prematurely, continue analyzing even if you think you found a solution"
    ```

    Ensures thorough problem exploration.

-   **Continuous Confidence Check** - _pacnpal_

    ```
    "Rate confidence (1-10) before saving files, after saving, after rejections, and before task completion"
    ```

    Maintains quality through self-assessment.

### Best Practices 🎯

-   **Project Structure** - _kvs007_

    ```
    "Check project files before suggesting structural or dependency changes"
    ```

    Maintains project integrity.

-   **Critical Thinking** - _chinesesoup_

    ```
    "Ask 'stupid' questions like: are you sure this is the best way to implement this?"
    ```

    Challenges assumptions and uncovers better solutions.

-   **Code Style** - _yellow_bat_coffee_

    ```
    Use words like "elegant" and "simple" in prompts
    ```

    May influence code organization and clarity.

-   **Setting Expectations** - _steventcramer_

    ```
    "THE HUMAN WILL GET ANGRY."
    ```

    (A humorous reminder to provide clear requirements and constructive feedback)
