# How to Use Google Gemini for Free with Caret

Caret allows you to use a Google Gemini API key and receive up to 400,000 KRW in free credits, making it possible to use Gemini at no cost. Here’s how:

## 1. Create a New Google Account

- **URL**: [https://accounts.google.com/](https://accounts.google.com/)
- **Required information**:
    - Account name
    - Account email
    - Recovery email or phone number

## 2. Issue a Gemini API Key

- **API Key issuance page**: [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- **Generate and copy the API Key**:
    - Click “Create API Key” to generate a key, then copy it.
    - This key will later be used in Caret’s Gemini API settings.

## 3. Set Up Google API Key in Caret
- **Select API Provider**: Choose Google Gemini as the API provider in Caret.
- **Paste Google Gemini API Key**: Paste the API Key issued from Google AI Studio.
- **Model**: We recommend setting the model to Gemini-1.5-flash or Gemini-1.5-pro. Gemini-1.5-flash is cheaper but has lower performance, so we recommend enabling extended thinking.

## 4. Access Google Cloud and Claim Free Credits

⚠️ **Important**: You will need a credit card for identity verification and account activation.

### i. Go to Google Cloud Console

- **URL**: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- At the top of the page, you should see a message about free credits.
- Click the button shown, and you’ll be redirected to a page displaying:
    > “$300 free credits available for 90 days of Google Cloud trial.”

⚠️ **Check carefully**: If it goes straight to “Go to Payment,” the credits may not be provided. Make sure you see the wording about “$300 (approx. 400,000 KRW) in free credits for 90 days.”

### ii. Final Confirmation

In the Google AI Studio API Key page, make sure you have:
- Activated a standard account
- Linked a billing account
- Upgraded to Tier 1

Only then will you be able to use the free credits.

### iii. Notes

- Google credits are not deducted in real-time. Usage is reflected with about a 1-day delay.
- To avoid unintended charges, regularly check your usage and remaining credits if you do not wish to continue with paid services.
