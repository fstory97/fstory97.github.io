## Core Principles Summary

To maintain consistency across the project, all internationalization efforts must follow these core principles, which are detailed in the main guide.

### 1. Feature-Based Namespaces
Each primary feature or view (e.g., `welcome`, `history`, `settings`) must have its own dedicated namespace, which corresponds to a JSON file in the `webview-ui/src/caret/locale/{language}/` directory.

-   **Example**: `t('history.title', 'history')`

### 2. Unified Provider Key Structure
All translation keys related to API Providers must be consolidated within the `settings.json` namespace under a single `providers` object. Each provider's translations are grouped by its unique ID.

-   **Standard Pattern**: `t('providers.{providerId}.{key}', 'settings')`
-   **Example**: `t('providers.openrouter.apiKeyLabel', 'settings')`
