## 概览

模型上下文协议是一个开放协议，标准化了应用程序为 LLM 提供上下文的方式。将 MCP 想象成 AI 应用程序的 USB-C 端口；它提供了将 AI 模型连接到不同数据源和工具的标准化方式。MCP 服务器充当大语言模型（LLM）（如 Claude）与外部工具或数据源之间的中介。它们是向 LLM 公开功能的小程序，使它们能够通过 MCP 与外部世界交互。MCP 服务器本质上就像 LLM 可以使用的 API。

## Key Concepts

MCP servers define a set of "**tools,**" which are functions the LLM can execute. These tools offer a wide range of capabilities.

**Here's how MCP works:**

-   **MCP hosts** discover the capabilities of connected servers and load their tools, prompts, and resources.
-   **Resources** provide consistent access to read-only data, akin to file paths or database queries.
-   **Security** is ensured as servers isolate credentials and sensitive data. Interactions require explicit user approval.

## Use Cases

The potential of MCP servers is vast. They can be used for a variety of purposes.

**Here are some concrete examples of how MCP servers can be used:**

-   **Web Services and API Integration:**
    -   Monitor GitHub repositories for new issues
    -   Post updates to Twitter based on specific triggers
    -   Retrieve real-time weather data for location-based services
-   **Browser Automation:**
    -   Automate web application testing
    -   Scrape e-commerce sites for price comparisons
    -   Generate screenshots for website monitoring
-   **Database Queries:**
    -   Generate weekly sales reports
    -   Analyze customer behavior patterns
    -   Create real-time dashboards for business metrics
-   **Project and Task Management:**
    -   Automate Jira ticket creation based on code commits
    -   Generate weekly progress reports
    -   Create task dependencies based on project requirements
-   **Codebase Documentation:**
    -   Generate API documentation from code comments
    -   Create architecture diagrams from code structure
    -   Maintain up-to-date README files

## Getting Started

Cline does not come with any pre-installed MCP servers. You'll need to find and install them separately.

**Choose the right approach for your needs:**

-   **Community Repositories:** Check for community-maintained lists of MCP servers on GitHub. See [Adding MCP Servers from Github](/mcp/adding-mcp-servers-from-github)
-   **Cline Marketplace:** Install one from Cline's [MCP Marketplace](/mcp/mcp-marketplace)
-   **Ask Cline:** You can ask Cline to help you find or create MCP servers
-   **Build Your Own:** Create custom MCP servers using the [MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/)
-   **Customize Existing Servers:** Modify existing servers to fit your specific requirements

## Integration with Cline

Cline simplifies the building and use of MCP servers through its AI capabilities.

### Building MCP Servers

-   **Natural language understanding:** Instruct Cline in natural language to build an MCP server by describing its functionalities. Cline will interpret your instructions and generate the necessary code.
-   **Cloning and building servers:** Cline can clone existing MCP server repositories from GitHub and build them automatically.
-   **Configuration and dependency management:** Cline handles configuration files, environment variables, and dependencies.
-   **Troubleshooting and debugging:** Cline helps identify and resolve errors during development.

### Using MCP Servers

-   **Tool execution:** Cline seamlessly integrates with MCP servers, allowing you to execute their defined tools.
-   **Context-aware interactions:** Cline can intelligently suggest using relevant tools based on conversation context.
-   **Dynamic integrations:** Combine multiple MCP server capabilities for complex tasks. For example, Cline could use a GitHub server to get data and a Notion server to create a formatted report.

## Security Considerations

When working with MCP servers, it's important to follow security best practices:

-   **Authentication:** Always use secure authentication methods for API access
-   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables
-   **Access Control:** Limit server access to authorized users only
-   **Data Validation:** Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
-   **Logging:** Implement secure logging practices without exposing sensitive data
