Safer, precise, efficient for small changes.\n\n**write_to_file**: Use for new files, major restructuring, or extensive changes.\n\n## Workflow Best Practices\n\n### Multiple Changes to Same File\n\n**IMPORTANT**: When you need to make several changes to the same file, prefer to use a **single replace_in_file call with multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks**. DO NOT make multiple successive replace_in_file calls for the same file.\n\n**Example**: Adding a component to a file\n- ✅ **Correct**: One replace_in_file call with:\n  - SEARCH/REPLACE block 1: Add import statement\n  - SEARCH/REPLACE block 2: Add component usage\n- ❌ **Wrong**: Separate replace_in_file calls for import and usage\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Fewer API requests (30-50% reduction)\n- Better context efficiency\n- Reduced user wait time\n- Optimized for Claude Sonnet 4.5\n\n## AGENT Mode Guidelines\n- Full file operation access\n- Apply multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in single call\n- Consider auto-formatting effects\n- Reference updated file state for subsequent edits\n\n## CHATBOT Mode Guidelines\n- Read-only file access\n- Suggest edits with multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in single suggestion\n- Analysis and planning only",
